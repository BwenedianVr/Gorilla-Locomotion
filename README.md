# Gorilla Locomotion
## 2d remake of the gorilla tag locomotion using javascript

### About
This is the source code to my 2D gorilla tag based locomotion. It is controlled the way you move in Getting Over It;
you control the hand using your mouse, and can push off of objects and also pull yourself into them.
This wasnt easy to make at all, and took many attempts (mainly because im new to javascript).

### Rules
• No stealing the code without proper credits. 

• No using the engine for bad things.

• No claiming the code as your own.

### How i made it
The basic idea for how the collision works started when i was in 6th grade, and at the time i was fascinated with the Getting Over It locomotion.
I started working on a Scratch rewrite of the locomotion, when i created a really good way for colliding objects.
in 2024, I recieved a vr for my 14th birthday. I immediatly started playing gorilla tag, and got farely good at it.
A few years later, I moved on from scratch to javascript. I started learning very fast, and immediatly wanted to remake gorilla tag.
Most of the remakes i had in javascript absolutely sucked, and i didnt fully make most of them by hand.
Fast forward some time and i decided to start using javascript again. I relearned everything to better understand it, and started working on a slither.io engine.
After some work, it was a success! It motivated me to start working on a 2d gorilla tag locomotion again, and this time, i remade it all by myself.
And it worked pretty well, except for the lag. So i started modifying my code until i found out a way to fix the lag: instead of constantly getting image data, it would grab it at the start.
This fixed all of the lag, and now im currently rewriting everything over again so that the code is more polished and the variables are more organized.
